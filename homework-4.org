* Task (100 pts)

  1. (10pts) Build truth tables for the following formulas:

     1. $\neg (A \wedge C) \vee B$

     2. $(A \rightarrow \neg B) \vee (B \leftrightarrow C)$

  2. (10pts) Find variable assignments that satisfy the following
     formulas, or state that no such assignment exists:

     1. $\neg (A \vee B) \wedge (\neg A \wedge B \wedge \neg C)$

     2. $C \leftrightarrow (\neg C \vee \neg A)$

  3. (10pts) Express the following statements in propositional logic:

     1. $B$ or $C$ is true whenever $A$ is true.

     2. $B$ is known to be true when $A$ is true.

     3. At most one of $R$, $S$, and $T$ can be true.

     4. The grass is wet if either it rained or the sprinkler was
        on. (Create propositional symbols, and give their
        definitions.)

  4. (20pts) We have a knowledge base that contains:

     - $(R \rightarrow S) \wedge Q$

     - $(J \wedge Q) \rightarrow P$

     - $Q \rightarrow Z$

     - $P \rightarrow \neg Q$

     - $(R \rightarrow S) \rightarrow (\neg H \rightarrow J)$

     Derive each of the following using inference rules for
     propositional logic:

     1. $Z$

     2. $\neg P$

     3. $\neg (J \wedge Q)$

     4. $\neg J$

     5. $H$

  5. (40pts) Rewrite the following statements in first-order logic,
     stating definitions for the predicates you use. (Note, some of
     these are /hard/; make an attempt...)

     1. James is a dolphin.

     2. Dolphins are mammals.

     3. Mammals have hair and three middle ear bones.

     4. Not all dolphins live in the ocean.

     5. Some mammals have sweat glands and specialized teeth.

     6. Vignesh stopped by his house before going to the party.

     7. The result of firing a loaded gun at a person is that the
        person dies.

     8. The /usual/ result of firing a loaded gun at a person is that
        the person dies (unless, the person has a bulletproof vest, or
        the gun misfires, or...)

     9. One of the teachers on this campus always gets spitballs
        launched at him whenever he turns around.

     10. The only mammals that lay eggs are the monotremes, and all
         but the playtpus are extinct. (You may need multiple
         logic "sentences" for this one.)

     11. I'm hungry.

     12. This sentence is false.
