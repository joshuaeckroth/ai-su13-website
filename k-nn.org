#+TITLE: k-nearest neighbor classification

Suppose we measure some properties of flowers, species of iris to be
precise. *But this time*, we also know their true "labels"
(species). We have a table like the following:

| Sepal length (cm) | Sepal width (cm) | Petal length (cm) | Petal width (cm) | Species         |
|-------------------+------------------+-------------------+------------------+-----------------|
|               5.1 |              3.5 |               1.4 |              0.2 | iris setosa     |
|               4.9 |              3.0 |               1.4 |              0.2 | iris setosa     |
|               4.7 |              3.2 |               1.3 |              0.2 | iris setosa     |
|               ... |              ... |               ... |              ... |                 |
|               7.0 |              3.2 |               4.7 |              1.4 | iris versicolor |
|               ... |              ... |               ... |              ... | ...             |
|               6.3 |              3.3 |               6.0 |              2.5 | iris virginica  |
|               ... |              ... |               ... |              ... | ...             |

Since we know the true labels, we do not need to use [[./k-means.html][k-means
clustering]] to find (approximate) the species clusters.

If we get a new set of measurements from a new plant, we can predict
(approximate, guess) which species it is by calculating the mean of
each species cluster and finding which mean is closest.

However, instead of calculating means we typically use a different
approach. (Perhaps the two approaches are equivalent; I am not sure.)

Given a new set of measurements, perform the following test:

  1. Find (using Euclidean distance, for example), the $k$ nearest
     entities from the training set. These entities have known labels. The
     choice of $k$ is left to us.

  2. Among these $k$ entities, which label is most common? That is the
     label for the unknown entity.

What we have is a voting mechanism, where the most votes
wins. Sometimes it is a good idea to give each vote a weight, such as
the inverse of the entity's distant from the unknown entity (so more
distance votes count for less).

The article "[[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016786550200394X][Choosing $k$ for two-class nearest neighbour classifiers
with unbalanced classes]]" by Hand and Vinciotti provides more
information and solutions for choosing $k$ when performing two-class
assignment (i.e., Yes/No assignments) when one class is substantially
larger than the other. They write in their conclusion,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Nearest neighbour supervised classification methods have many
attractive properties. However, many of these are based on asymptotic
arguments. In problems where the classification threshold lies near 0
or 1, as generally is the case in situations where one class is much
larger than the other, the fact that $k$ is finite results in a
non-monotonic relationship between the proportion of each class
correctly classified as $k$ varies. This means that, in general,
larger $k$ may not yield better performance than smaller $k$.

An example of how the choice of $k$ affects performance may be found
in the [[./document-classification.html][document classification]] notes.

** Handwritten digit recognition

Consider the following dataset, available from [[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits][UCI]]. Thirty people
wrote 3823 digits (0-9), which were then scanned as images and
translated into 64 features. Specifically, each digit was scanned into
a 32x32 pixel black-and-white image, which was divided into 4x4 pixel
blocks (64 of them); the number of black pixels in each 4x4 block was
counted. These counts constitute the 64 features.

The plot below shows each of the 3823 entities in the testing
set. Because the feature vector of each entity has 64 dimensions, we
cannot simply plot the feature vectors themselves. Instead, I reduced
the dimensionality to 2D using "multidimensional scaling." This
technique calculates the distance from each entity to each other
entity, creating a 3823x3823 matrix of distances. Then these distances
are reduced to two dimensions by finding an x,y pair for each entity
that respects its distances to the other entities. The scaling is not
perfect, but generally serves as a good approximation of how
"different" each entity is from each other entity.

#+BEGIN_CENTER
[[./images/optdigits-true-class-mds.png]]
#+END_CENTER

We see that each digit generally forms a cluster, although there is
some overlap. The overlap may well be an artifact of the
multidimensional scaling; perhaps there is no overlap if the data were
to be graphed in more dimensions.

The k-nearest neighbor algorithm can be visualized using this
plot. Say we get a new image, and we want our software to figure out
which digit it is. We find the $k$ nearest examples from the training
set, and figure out what is the most common digit among those
examples. Looking at the plot, we can imagine that if the new entity
would be placed in the bottom-middle area, that most of its nearest
neighbors would be green, representing the digit 4.

In fact, tests with this dataset have shown that the following $k$
values produce the corresponding recognition accuracies:

| k value | accuracy |
|---------+----------|
| 1       | 98.00    |
| 2       | 97.38    |
| 3       | 97.83    |
| 4       | 97.61    |
| 5       | 97.89    |
| 6       | 97.77    |
| 7       | 97.66    |
| ...     | ...      |

These are rather high accuracies for such a /simple/ algorithm.

** How to handle noise

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Some of the labeled training examples may be surround by the examples
from the other classes. Such a situation may arise by plenty of
reasons: (i) as a resut of a random mistake, (ii) because insufficient
number of traning example of this class (an isolated example appears
instead of cluster), (iii) because incomplete system of features (the
classes are separated in other dimensions which we do not know), (iv)
because there are too many training examples of other classes
(unbalanced classes) that create too dense "hostile" background for
the given small class and many other reasons. ([[http://www.math.le.ac.uk/people/ag153/homepage/KNN/KNN3.html][source]])
#+END_QUOTE

We can handle outliers by just removing them from the dataset. They
won't contribute any useful information for classification. Outliers
can be detected by defining two values $q \geq r > 0$ and say that a
point is an outlier with respect to some class if, among its $q$
nearest neighbors, there are more than $r$ examples from other
classes.

** Example exercise

Ensure that the parameters are at default settings

  1. Create a class with green colour by clicking at the top left
     corner of the work desk and also click on random to create some
     outliers

  2. Create a second class with blue colour by clicking at the bottom
     right corner of the work desk and also click on random to create
     some outliers

  3. Test a query example at the centre. (Hint: click on handle test
     menu, ensure the method is KNN and click at the centre of the
     work desk. Example screen shot is shown below)

#+BEGIN_CENTER

#+END_CENTER

  1. Classify the test query using different values of $k$ = 3, 5, 10
     and 20. (To change $k$, Go to Parameter menu, change the Number
     of Nearest Neighbour, click Handle test Menu and click the point
     you want to classify, i.e., center of the work desk)

  2. Does varying the value of $k$ affect the classification and which
     $k$ gives a better classification?

  3. Calculate the map at the various $k$. What can you observe?

* Remarks

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
What is the inductive bias of k-nearest neighbor? The inductive bias
corresponds to an assumption that the classification of an instance
$x$, will be most similar to the classification of other instances
that are nearby in Euclidean distance. 

One practical issue in applying k-nearest neighbor algorithms is that
the distance between instances is calculated based on all attributes
of the instance (i.e., on all axes in the Euclidean space containing
the instances). This lies in contrast to methods such as rule and
decision tree learning systems that select only a subset of the
instance attributes when forming the hypothesis. To see the effect of
this policy, consider applying k-nearest neighbor to a problem in
which each instance is described by 20 attributes, but where only 2 of
these attributes are relevant to determining the classification for
the particular target function. In this case, instances that have
identical values for the 2 relevant attributes may nevertheless be
distant from one another in the 20-dimensional instance space.  As a
result, the similarity metric used by k-nearest neighbor --- depending
on all 20 attributes-will be misleading. The distance between
neighbors will be dominated by the large number of irrelevant
attributes. This difficulty, which arises when many irrelevant
attributes are present, is sometimes referred to as the curse of
dimensionality. Nearest-neighbor approaches are especially sensitive
to this problem.

[...]

One additional practical issue in applying k-nearest neighbor is
efficient memory indexing. Because this algorithm delays all
processing until a new query is received, significant computation can
be required to process each new query. Various methods have been
developed for indexing the stored training examples so that the
nearest neighbors can be identified more efficiently at some
additional cost in memory. One such indexing method is the $kd$-tree,
in which instances are stored at the leaves of a tree, with nearby
instances stored at the same or nearby nodes. The internal nodes of
the tree sort the new query $x_q$, to the relevant leaf by testing
selected attributes of $x_q$.
