* Text book
The text book is not required. [[http://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-Edition/dp/0136042597/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1332257784&sr=1-1][Artificial Intelligence: A Modern
Approach]], by Russell and Norvig.

* Homework

Homework must be submitted on the CSE Linux servers, using the
~submit~ command. All programs must compile and execute without error
on the Linux servers. Thus, be sure to test your code on those servers
before submitting it.

Instructions about the Linux servers are available in [[./linux.html][lecture notes]].

* Grading

  - Homeworks: 40%
  - Midterm: 30%
  - Final: 30%

Late work is penalized 20 points, no matter how late it is. The last
day to turn in late work is the day of the Final.

Note that if I suspect you copied your homework solutions from someone
(or something) else, I reserve the right to ask you many probing
questions about those solutions. If you do not answer those questions
to my satisfaction, I reserve the right to give you a 0% grade on that
assignment.

* Academic misconduct
This course is designed for individual work.

The only work required of you outside of class is homework
assignments. During the midterm and final exam, there is no tolerance
for cheating (looking at others' work). However, you may participate
in a reasonable amount of collaboration over homeworks. Collaboration
is limited to: discussing how to approach the solution, or how to
solve small coding problems; looking at the Internet for information
about general topics, not solutions to the particulars of the homework
assignment. It is considered academic misconduct if you copy
significant portions of code from anyone (the Internet included). Your
solutions should not bear an uncanny resemblance to anyone else’s
code. It should be clear to you what I mean by this; do not test the
limits of this (fairly liberal) policy. Violators will be referred to
the OSU Committee on Academic Misconduct (COAM).

* Disability statement
Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the
impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss your
specific needs. You should contact the Office for Disability Services
at 614-292-3307 in room 150 Pomerene Hall to coordinate reasonable
accommodations for documented disabilities.
