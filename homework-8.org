* Task 1 (25 pts)

Refer to the [[./bayesian-inference.html][Bayesian inference notes]].

  - Compute $P(fire=T|smoke=T)$.

  - Compute $P(alarm=T|smoke=T)$.

  - Compute the probability that there is a fire if somebody reports
    it and you are certain the fire alarm has not been tampered with.

* Task 2 (25 pts)

Using the näive Bayesian assumption, calculate the most likely
explanation (i.e., which of $a$, $b$, or $c$ is true) given that the
following has been observed: $x=false$, $y=true$, $z=true$.

Recall that the näive Bayesian assumption says that $x$, $y$, $z$ are
independent of each other given the cause $a$, $b$, or $c$. In other
words, $P(x,y,z|a)=P(x|a)P(y|a)P(z|a)$ (for $b$ and $c$ also).

  - $P(x=true|a=true) = 0.1$

  - $P(x=true|b=true) = 0.3$

  - $P(x=true|c=true) = 0.7$

  - $P(y=true|a=true) = 0.3$

  - $P(y=true|b=true) = 0.5$

  - $P(y=true|c=true) = 0.8$

  - $P(z=true|a=true) = 0.6$

  - $P(z=true|b=true) = 0.4$

  - $P(z=true|c=true) = 0.6$

  - $P(a) = 0.3$

  - $P(b) = 0.7$

  - $P(c) = 0.5$

* Task 3 (10 pts)

Write binary vectors and frequency vectors for the following
documents:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Document 1: "the cat in the hat seuss the cat hat hat seuss the hat"

Document 2: "green eggs and ham seuss the ham green and the ham and"

Document 3: "horton hears who seuss and in the horton the who hears"
#+END_QUOTE

* Task 4 (10 pts)

Compute (by hand) the /tf-idf/ scores for each of the words in the
documents from Task 3.

* Task 5 (30 pts)

Report the best (in terms of average F-score) classification algorithm
and feature vector pairing for the [[./sms-spam.arff][sms-spam.arff]] dataset. Use [[./weka.html][Weka]] to
do this. Be sure to try:

  - k-nearest neighbor with $k=1,2,3$ and,
    - Binary feature vectors
    - Frequency feature vectors
    - tf-idf feature vectors

  - Naïve Bayes with binary feature vectors

Use 10-fold cross-validation.
