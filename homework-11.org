* Task 1 (100 pts)

These are Asimov's "Three Laws of Robotics":

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a
   human being to come to harm.

2. A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except
   where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection
   does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

Give your opinion about whether these are good "laws," how they might
be improved, and whether we could build systems that respect
them. (1-2 paragraphs)
