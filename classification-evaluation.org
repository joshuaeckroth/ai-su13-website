#+TITLE: Classification evaluation

Assume we have a classifier that adds labels (classes) to each
document or data point. How do we evaluate how well it is doing its
job? We have three cases, considering all predicted labels as a group:

- True positive (tp) :: predicted labels that are true labels

- False positive (fp) :: predicted labels that are not true labels

- False negatives (fn) :: true labels that were not predicted

Since these measures depend on the number of labels (predicted and
true), and that may differ depending on the document/data point or
experiment, we calculate the following normalized scores:

- Precision :: $tp/(tp+fp)$ --- higher precision means the labels
               that were predicted were more often true labels

- Recall :: $tp/(tp+fn)$ --- higher recall means more of the true
            labels were predicted

We can achieve very high precision by only predicting labels for which
we have very high confidence (until we nearly choose no labels at
all); this would decrease recall, however. We can achieve high recall
by predicting every label for every data point; this would decrease
precision, however.

Best would be high precision and high recall. We can measure this by
combining precision and recall into a single formula, called the
"F-score" or "F1-measure":

- F-score :: $2*precision*recall / (precision + recall)$

Notice that precision and recall are treated equally in this
calcuation. Technically, the F-score is the harmonic mean of precision
and recall.

This graph (from [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Harmonic_mean_3D_plot_from_0_to_100.png][Wikipedia]]) shows the harmonic mean of two numbers
($x$ and $y$, which you can interpret as $precision$ and $recall$). It
shows the relationship we want: if either $x$ or $y$ is $0$, the
F-score is $0$. Otherwise, the F-score generally increases with
increases in $x$ and $y$.
